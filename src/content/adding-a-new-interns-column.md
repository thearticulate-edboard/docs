# Adding a new interns column

1. [Create a new markdown file](../creating-and-managing-new-markdown-files.md) with the following content, replacing relevant parts as necessary

```markdown
---
title: "Ricky Ponting"
authid: 01-batch-2018
img: https://link/to/image
tags: []
date: 2023-07-20T05:45:38+05:30
aka: "Punter"
---

Rest of the content..
```

## Points to remember
1. The date will decide the order of appearance of any work in the Home page and other listing pages of the magazine. Manipulate it as necessary, without deviating from the format.
2. The `aka` field will correspond to nickname shown under their name in the index page of Intern's column. It is not mandatory.
