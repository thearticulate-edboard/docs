# Image Dimensions

- All images should be converted to `webp` format. All popular platforms have software that allow conversion to this format. Below given is a non-comprehensive list of software which permits conversion as well as resizing of images. 
	- Windows: GIMP
	- Linux: Imagemagick, Converseen, GIMP
	- Mac: GIMP
	- Android: #todo

NOTE: In near future, when support for AVIF format is more widespread, it should be preferred over `webp` format. At this point Edge browser in windows lacks support for it. See [AVIF usage data](https://caniuse.com/avif)
